<h6>PHOTODIARY</h6>
<h1>THE PERFECT WEEKEND GETWAY HERE</h1>
<p class="photodiaryhone">A diary is a book that is used to record events as they happen, or to plan for future events. For example, you might use it to note down important dates throughout the year to stay organised, or you might use it to note down your thoughts on a daily basis</p>

    <h6>LIFESTYLE</h6>
    <h1>MORE THAN JUST MUSIC FESTIBLE</h1>
    <p>Music festivals have come a long way since the psychedelic wig-outs of the '60s. These days, there's a festival for everyone, even if you've shunned most annual mud-fests in the past because you dance to disco and you don't like rock. Beyond the traditional London, UK and European festivals, there are fantastic international events from California's very Instagram-friendly Coachella to Japan's fabulous Fuji Rock, which prides itself on being the 'cleanest festival in the world'. </p>

    <h1>LIFE TASTE BETTER WITH COFFEE</h1>
    <p>Coffee is not just a beverage, rather it is a nostalgia! Coffee is an inseparable part of our lives. Right from beginning the day to unwinding the day, coffee is our best companion, but did you know that your eternal love for coffee can actually change your sense of taste. Yes, this might sound strange but as per a recent study, drinking too much dark coffee can affect your sense of taste.</p>
